### Structure
- `Material`: Documents used to organise the online course, such as the invitation and instructions for the course, the sample projects for each lesson and templates for the supervisors
- `Lessons`: Tasks and solutions for each lesson in the course
- `Data`: Anonymised data from the course, such as the survey results and the manual and automated analysis of the projects for each session
- `Analysis`: Scripts for the analysis of the survey and projects of the course

Only the anonymised raw data is made available here since some data cannot be fully anonymised and is therefore only made available for scientific use on request.
If you have additional questions about the design or data, please contact Isabella Graßl (isabella.grassl@uni-passau.de).
